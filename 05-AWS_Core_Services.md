# AWS Core Services (and concepts)
 The following concepts and list of AWS Core Services are essential to understand various layers of an architecture.
AWS offers [Trusted Advisor](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/) tool to business and higher subscriptions.
    * Provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.
    * Benefits: cost optimization, performance, security, fault tolerance and service quotas.

 For example, a web-based enterprise application will utilize most if no all the layers and select technologies.
## Architecture

1. [Elasticity](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/cloud-elasticity-vs-cloud-scalability): The ability to add or remove resources based on demand.
1. [Scalability](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/asset_files/TechnicalNote/2006_004_001_14681.pdf): Scalability is the ability to handle increased workload by repeatedly applying a cost-effective strategy for extending a system’s capacity
1. [Fault Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance): Is the property that enables a system to continue operating properly in the event of a failure of one or more faults withing some if its components.
1. [High Availability](https://redis.com/blog/high-availability-architecture/): Property of a system to serve the business without failure over a given period of time.
1. [Principle of least priviledge](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/bsi/articles/knowledge/principles/least-privilege): Every program and every user of the system should operate using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the job. Primarily, this principle limits the damage that can result from an accident or error.

## Billing
1. [AWS Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html)
    * Account management services that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS Accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
    * Use case: ease of billing, budgetary, security and compliance needs.
1. [Consolidated billing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/consolidated-billing.html)
    * AWS Organizations has a management account that pays the charges of all the member accounts.
    * Multiple AWS Accounts can be consolidated for billing and payments.
## Security
1. [Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/)
    * AWS Network Firewall automatically scales your network firewall to protect your managed infrastructure.
    * Open source rule formats and underlying rules engine easily implements policies.
1. [IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
   * Identity and Access Managment (IAM) sets and manages guardrails and fine-grained access controls for your workforce and workloads.
   * Centrally connect identities to multiple AWS accounts.
   * Grant temporary security credentials for workloads that access your AWS resources.
   * Continually analyze access to right-size permissions on the journey to least privilege.
   * Usecase: "Who can access what" Who=users and workloads. Can access= Permissions with IAM policy. What=Resources within your AWS organization.
1. [Security Group (SG)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html)
    * Is a virtual firewall for EC2 instances to control incomcing and outgoing traffic.
1. [User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html)
    * Each identity has unique credentials within AWS.
    * Identity types: Account Root User, AWS Identity and Access Management user, AWS IAM Identity Center user and Federated identity.
1. [Access Control List (ACL)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acls.html): 
    * A firewall layer on the subnet level.
    * ACL cannot grant permissions to users in the account.
    * ACL can grant basic read/write permissions to other AWS accounts to buckets and objects.
## Networking and Content Delivery
1. [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/) : Global Traffic
    * Improve application availability, performance, and security using the AWS global network.
    * Usecases: global traffic manager, API acceleration, Global static IP, low-latency gaming and media workloads.
    * Global accelerator sends your users through the AWS global network when accessing your content, speeding up delivery.
1. [AWS Transit Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) : No more peering
    * AWS Transit Gateway connects your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks through a central hub. 
    * Put an end to complex peering relationships. 
    * Highly scalable cloud router where each new connection is made only once.
1. [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html): Slice of the cloud
    * Foundational service that creates a private virtual network to launch resources.
    * Spans AZs in a region.
    * VPC A and VPC B can be [peered](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) so they act as one logical VPC.You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different Regions (also known as an inter-Region VPC peering connection).
    * The default VPC always exists in every region. But all new VPCs are region specific.
1. [Subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html) : One per AZ
    * A subnet is a range of IP address in the VPC. This is a sub-network which allows you to split the network inside the VPC - it is where resources such as EC2 can be launched.
    * A private subnet is a good choice for hosting a Database - it will not be accessible directly from the Internet
    * A public subnet is a good choice for hosting a WebServer - however it requires a NACL, Router and IG to ensure Internet connectivity
    * Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones. For HA, launch EC2 instances into subnets of separate AZs
    * Public subnet: The subnet has a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a public subnet can access the public internet.
    * Private subnet: The subnet does not have a direct route to an internet gateway. Resources in a private subnet require a NAT device to access the public internet.
    * VPN-only subnet: The subnet has a route to a Site-to-Site VPN connection through a virtual private gateway. The subnet does not have a route to an internet gateway.
    * A subnet CIDR reservation is a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses that you set aside so that AWS can't assign them to your network interfaces. 
1. [NACL versus Security Group](https://gocloudtech.medium.com/aws-security-groups-vs-nacl-whats-the-difference-a38b9eb6796b) Subnet and Instance traffic rules.
    * NACL is `stateless` and allow one-way traffic i.e. separatly specific inbound and outbound traffic to the subnet.
    * NACL allow and deny rules are supported. NACLs have an implicit `deny`. NACL rules are processed in order.
    * Security Group is stateful i.e. rules for inbound and outbound to EC2 instances are same. They allow return traffic.
    * Security Group only supports `allow` rules. 
1. [CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html): CDN
    * A Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    * Provides low latency for content delivery.
    * Global distribution even when it is hosted in a region.

1. [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/): DNS
    * DNS Service that routes users to Internet applications.
    * Domain Name System - a DNS server translates a domain name to an IP address.
